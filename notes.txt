what is the formula for getting the left child of a Heap root node? Right child? 

if the parent node is index i: 
left childe: 2i + 1 
right child: 2i + 2 

what is a prioriy queue? 

A queue data structure with some addition properties:

What is the time-complexity of heap sort? 

nlogn 

building a heap takes n and the "sort "down phase, which repeatedly extracts takes nlogn" 
heapify by itself takes logn time 

What are the steps for Heap sort? 

1. Build a max heap from all of our data using a build max heap function 
2. once the largest item is at the root node, and every parent node is larger than its children, swap the largest value with th eitem at the ned of the heap 
3. the right item might be in the right place, but probbaly not, so move the node to the righ tplace using the heapify funciton.
